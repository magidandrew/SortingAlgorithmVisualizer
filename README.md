# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Demo
[insert demo gif here]

## Who this is for
- Any student who wants to see an implementation of common sorting algorithms in Java.
- Anyone who is interested in combining Swing gui with Processing graphics applications.
- For myself, as I wanted to develop a better fluency with swing and sorting algorithms
while being able to make an interesting visual product.

## Algorithms
All algorithms were self-implemented and can be located in the Algorithms package.
The following algorithms are currently implemented:
- BubbleSort

The following will be implemented in the near future:
-  InsertionSort 
-  SelectionSort
-  MergeSort
-  HeapSort
-  QuickSort
-  ShellSort
-  BubbleSort
-  CombSort
-  CountingSort
-  BucketSort
-  RadixSort
-  TreeSort
-  CubeSort

## Installation
TODO: allow build with ant.

## Dependencies
The program is written entirely in Java using the swing and Processing libraries.
- Swing
- [Processing3](https://processing.org/download/)
